Summary: My Game is a zombie game about a survivor who is trapped on an island 
surrounded by the zombie apocalypse. His mission is to escape the horde of zombies 
without being bit in order to survive and get to the checkpoint where he must 
await the helicopter that will take him to safety. The survivors must make the smartest 
decisions based on their surroundings in order to survive. The Island is based on a city
with sewage ways, tunnels, streets, buildings, water, grass, etc. These surroundings can 
save day for the survivors or they can be the end for them. Enjoy (;
